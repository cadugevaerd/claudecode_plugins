# Agentc AI Developer

Complete guide for developing AI agents from conception to production through structured **Microprocessos**. This plugin implements the **Brief Minimo** methodology with integrated commands for planning, setup, and execution.

## Overview

Agentc AI Developer is your partner in building production-ready AI agents through proven methodologies:

- **Microprocesso 1.1** (`/brief`) - Agent planning with Brief Minimo methodology
- **Microprocesso 1.2** (`/setup-local-observability`) - Environment setup with reproducibility and observability

Works with **new agents** and integrates seamlessly with **existing projects**.

## What is Brief Minimo?

Brief Minimo is a structured planning methodology that answers 5 fundamental questions about your AI agent:

1. **What does the agent DO?** - Core functionality in one clear action verb
1. **What is the INPUT?** - Type, format, maximum size, real example
1. **What is the OUTPUT?** - Expected structure, success example, error example
1. **What is the TOOL/API?** - Single tool, access confirmation, cost, backup alternative
1. **What is SUCCESS?** - Quantifiable metric, minimum target, measurement method, dataset availability

## Installation

````bash
/plugin install agentc-ai-developer

```text

## Quick Start

### Microprocesso 1.1: Planning with Brief Minimo

Start your agent planning session:

```bash
/brief

```text

This launches an interactive interview that guides you through the Brief Minimo process. The agent automatically detects your context and offers relevant options.

**Result**: README.md with complete agent specification ✅

### Microprocesso 1.2: Environment Setup & Observability

After `/brief` creates your project repository, continue with environment setup:

```bash
/setup-local-observability

```text

This guides you interactively through:
- ✅ Python virtual environment setup
- ✅ Dependency installation (langchain, anthropic, langsmith)
- ✅ Environment configuration (.env + .gitignore)
- ✅ LangSmith integration for observability
- ✅ Complete validation and testing

**Result**: Reproducible environment with complete observability ready for development! 🚀

**Total time**: ~2 hours (planning + environment setup)

## How It Works

### 1. Run the Command

```bash
/brief

```text

### 2. Interactive Interview

The command conducts a conversational interview directly:

- Welcomes you and explains the process
- Asks each of the 5 fundamental questions
- Collects concrete examples (not vague descriptions)
- Validates completeness before proceeding
- Clarifies with follow-up questions as needed

### 3. Specification Document

At the end, you receive a comprehensive **README.md** containing:

- Your agent's complete specification
- Input/output examples
- Tool/API requirements
- Success metrics and measurement strategy
- Next steps for development

### 4. Use as Blueprint

Use the generated specification document as the reference for:

- Architecture and design phase
- Development and implementation
- Testing and validation
- Production deployment

### 5. Project Integration (Optional)

After planning and environment setup, run `/update-claude-md` to integrate guidance into your project's CLAUDE.md:

```bash
/update-claude-md

```text

This adds a concise section (≤40 lines) with command references and next steps for ongoing development.

## Why Brief Minimo?

This methodology prevents common agent planning failures:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ❌ Vague requirements | ✅ Crystal clear specifications |
| ❌ Scope creep | ✅ Focused single responsibility |
| ❌ Undefined success | ✅ Quantifiable metrics |
| ❌ Technical surprises | ✅ Tool/API validation upfront |
| ❌ Hidden costs | ✅ Budget awareness from day one |
| ❌ Integration nightmares | ✅ Input/output specs before coding |

## Best Practices

### When Using Brief Minimo

✅ **DO**:
- Provide specific, concrete examples
- Include real data samples (not conceptual ones)
- Be honest about constraints and budget
- Have stakeholders available for clarification
- Document everything the brief defines

❌ **DON'T**:
- Accept vague answers - ask "Can you show me an example?"
- Plan multiple tools at once - start with ONE
- Skip the metric definition - "We'll see if it works" isn't good enough
- Assume common knowledge - always ask for clarification
- Put off decisions - Brief Minimo is faster than discovering requirements during development

### Question-by-Question Tips

#### Question 1 (What does it DO?)

- Use strong action verbs: analyze, classify, fetch, generate, summarize
- One sentence should describe the complete function
- Example: "Classifies customer support emails by priority (high/medium/low)"

#### Question 2 (What is the INPUT?)

- Be specific about format: plain text, JSON, CSV, email body, etc.
- Include realistic maximum size limits
- Show a real example from your actual data
- Example: "Plain text email subject + body, max 10 KB, from support inbox"

#### Question 3 (What is the OUTPUT?)

- Define exact JSON/data structure with field names and types
- Show what success looks like with real output
- Show what errors look like (null values, error messages, etc.)
- Example: {priority: "high", category: "system_outage", ...}

#### Question 4 (What is the TOOL/API?)

- Choose ONE primary tool to start with
- Have API keys and access confirmed
- Understand the cost (free tier? pricing limits?)
- Define the backup plan explicitly
- Example: "OpenWeather API, free tier, backup is cached data"

#### Question 5 (What is SUCCESS?)

- Define as a specific percentage or number, not a feeling
- 85% accuracy, 1-second response time, 0 false positives, etc.
- Have test data available to measure this metric
- Know how often you'll validate this metric
- Example: "85% classification accuracy measured weekly on 100 emails"

## Usage Modes

The `brief-assistant` agent adapts to your context and automatically offers the right mode:

### Mode 1: New Agent (Default)

**When**: Starting a new agent from scratch
**Output**: Complete specification document (README.md)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

```bash
/brief

# Agent detects no existing agents

# → "Let's create a new agent brief!"

# → Full 30-minute interview

```text

### Mode 2: Existing Agent Update

**When**: Refining or updating an already developed agent
**Use Cases**:
- Document production agents that evolved during development
- Refine scope of existing agents
- Plan improvements and new features
- Keep brief aligned with current implementation

**Output**: Updated brief reflecting current state
**Duration**: ~15-20 minutes

```bash
/brief

# Agent detects existing agents in project

# → "Update existing agent or create new one?"

# → Select agent to update

# → Interview focused on changes since original planning

```text

### Mode 3: Validate Agent

**When**: Checking if existing agent matches Brief Minimo criteria
**Use Cases**:
- Quality assurance and completeness check
- Scope verification
- Identify specification gaps
- Team alignment on agent requirements

**Output**: Validation report with gaps and recommendations
**Duration**: ~20 minutes

```bash
/brief

# → "Validate agent against Brief Minimo criteria"

# → Assessment of each criterion (purpose, input/output, tools, success)

# → Report with gaps and improvement suggestions

```text

### Mode 4: Document Existing Agent

**When**: Adding brief documentation to already-built agents
**Use Cases**:
- Retroactive documentation of production agents
- Team onboarding and knowledge sharing
- Creating specification from working implementation
- Preserving institutional knowledge

**Output**: Brief specification created retroactively
**Duration**: ~20 minutes

```bash
/brief

# → "Document existing agent implementation"

# → Questions about what agent actually does (from code review)

# → Generate brief based on current implementation

```text

## Using in Existing Projects

The plugin works seamlessly with existing projects:

1. **Run `/brief`** - Agent detects your existing setup
2. **Choose Mode** - Select from: New Agent, Update, Validate, or Document
3. **Answer Questions** - Brief interview adapted to your mode
4. **Get Output** - New specification, updated brief, validation report, or documentation
5. **Use as Reference** - Keep brief as specification for future improvements

### Example: Updating a Production Agent

```text

You have a "email_classifier" agent running in production for 6 months.

1. Run: /brief
2. Agent detects existing agents
3. Choose: "Update existing agent"
4. Select: "email_classifier"
5. Interview focuses on:
   - What has changed since original planning?
   - Any changes to input/output specs?
   - Updated success metrics?
   - Changes to tool/API or costs?
6. Output: Updated brief reflecting current state and improvements
7. Share with team: New team members reference updated brief

```text

### Example: Documenting a Legacy Agent

```text

You have an "error_processor" agent built 2 years ago with minimal docs.

1. Run: /brief
2. Agent detects existing agents
3. Choose: "Document existing agent"
4. Select: "error_processor"
5. Interview questions focus on current implementation:
   - What does this agent really do? (from code analysis)
   - What inputs does it accept? (from actual usage)
   - What outputs does it produce? (from current behavior)
   - What tool/API does it use? (from implementation)
   - How do you measure its success? (from monitoring/logs)
6. Output: Brief specification retroactively created
7. Store as reference: New developers understand agent without reading code

```text

## Example: Email Priority Agent

Here's how the Brief Minimo process works for a real agent:

### Question 1: What does it DO?
"Analyzes customer support emails and assigns priority levels (high/medium/low) based on urgency and issue type"

### Question 2: What is the INPUT?
- Type: Plain text email
- Format: Subject and body separated by newline
- Max size: 10 KB (roughly 2000 tokens)
- Example: Real customer support email from your inbox

### Question 3: What is the OUTPUT?

```json
{
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "category": "system_outage|bug|feature_request|billing|other",
  "summary": "Brief one-liner description",
  "action_required": true|false
}

```text

Success example:

```json
{
  "priority": "high",
  "category": "system_outage",
  "summary": "Production database unreachable",
  "action_required": true
}

```text

### Question 4: What is the TOOL/API?
- Primary: OpenWeather API (if weather-based classifications are needed)
- Endpoint: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
- Auth: Free API key
- Cost: Free tier available, no charge for this use case
- Backup: Use cached weather data from file if API unavailable

### Question 5: What is SUCCESS?
- Metric: Classification accuracy (% of emails correctly prioritized)
- Target: 85% minimum accuracy
- Measurement: Manual review of 100 random emails weekly
- Dataset: 2 years of labeled historical customer support emails
- Success indicator: 85+ emails correctly classified in weekly test set

**Result**: Complete specification ready for architecture and development!
