# Brief Minimo - AI Agent Planning

**INTERACTIVE**: Guides you through a complete 30-minute Brief Minimo planning session - no agent delegation.

Fully interactive command that asks 5 fundamental questions, validates your responses for specificity, and generates a production-ready README.md specification document.

## TL;DR

`/brief` → Answer 5 questions → Validation → README.md specification

**Time**: ~30 minutes
**Result**: Complete Brief Minimo specification ready for architecture & development

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

- ✅ 15-20 minutes of focused time
- ✅ Clear idea of what your agent should do (or existing agent to update/document)
- ✅ Concrete examples ready (not conceptual descriptions)
- ✅ Be prepared to think about specific metrics and tools

## The 5 Fundamental Questions

The Brief Minimo methodology asks you to answer these 5 clear questions:

1. **What does the agent DO?** - Core functionality in one clear action verb
1. **What is the INPUT?** - Data type, format, maximum size, real example
1. **What is the OUTPUT?** - Expected structure, success example, error example
1. **What is the TOOL/API?** - Single tool, access confirmation, cost, backup alternative
1. **What is SUCCESS?** - Quantifiable metric, minimum target, measurement method, dataset availability

## Execution Flow

1. **Context Detection** - Check if new project or existing agent
1. **Interactive Interview** - Answer 5 questions with validation feedback
1. **Review & Refinement** - Verify answers are specific and complete
1. **Generate README.md** - Produce production-ready specification

## Getting Started

Simply run:

````bash
/brief

```text

**What to have ready**:

- 15-20 minutes of focused time
- Clear idea of what your agent should do (or existing agent to document)
- Concrete examples (not conceptual descriptions)

**Respond with**:

- Specific details and examples
- Real sample data (not generic descriptions)
- Measurable metrics (not vague goals)
- Concrete implementation details (not "we'll figure it out later")

## The Brief Minimo Output

After completion, you'll have:

✅ **Agent Purpose** - Clear, single-sentence description with action verb
✅ **Input Specification** - Type, format, size limits, real examples
✅ **Output Specification** - Exact structure, success cases, error handling
✅ **Tool/API Requirements** - Primary tool, auth, costs, backup plan
✅ **Success Metrics** - Quantifiable targets, measurement method, validation strategy

All packaged in a **production-ready README.md** specification.

After running `/brief`, you'll have:

✅ Complete Brief Minimo specification in README.md
✅ Everything needed for architecture and design
✅ Crystal-clear input/output examples
✅ Quantifiable success metrics
✅ Tool/API requirements validated
✅ Ready for Microprocesso 1.2 (`/setup-local-observability`)

The brief becomes your specification reference throughout development.
