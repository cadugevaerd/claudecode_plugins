# /update-claude-md - Project Integration

Adds a concise section to your project's CLAUDE.md file with guidance for using Agentc AI Developer Microprocessos in your ongoing work. Integration takes <1 minute.

## What It Does

When you run `/update-claude-md`, the command:

1. **Reads your project context**
   - Looks for README.md generated by `/brief` command
   - Extracts Brief Minimo specification (project name, what agent does)
   - Validates that Microprocesso 1.1 has been completed

2. **Creates concise CLAUDE.md section**
   - Adds ≤40 lines of focused guidance
   - Lists available Agentc commands (`/brief`, `/setup-local-observability`)
   - Explains when to use each command
   - Links to plugin documentation for details
   - Adds next steps (Microprocesso 1.3 when available)

3. **Uses progressive disclosure**
   - Keeps CLAUDE.md lightweight
   - Details reference `plugins/agentc-ai-developer/README.md`
   - Skills and commands auto-discovered when plugin is installed

## Using the Command

```bash
/update-claude-md
```

**Prerequisites**:
- You have run `/brief` in this project
- README.md exists with Brief Minimo specification
- Project's CLAUDE.md exists (or will be created)

**Result**:
- New section added to CLAUDE.md (~35 lines)
- Guidance visible to Claude when working on your project
- Commands and next steps clearly documented

## What Gets Added to CLAUDE.md

Example section added (≤40 lines):

```markdown
---

## Agentc AI Developer (Microprocesso 1.1 + 1.2)

**Commands for agent planning and environment setup:**

- **`/brief`**: Review or update your Brief Minimo specification
- **`/setup-local-observability`**: Re-run environment setup or troubleshoot configuration

**When to use**:
- Plan new features: Run `/brief` to validate scope before development
- Update environment: Run `/setup-local-observability` if dependencies change
- Need help: Run `/help` (available through help-assistant)

**Full documentation**: See `plugins/agentc-ai-developer/README.md`

**Next step**: Microprocesso 1.3 (Spike Agentic - coming soon)

```

## Key Features

✅ **Concise**: Never exceeds 40 lines (follows best practices)
✅ **Contextual**: Reads your project's Brief Minimo specification
✅ **Auto-discovery**: Mentions that skills/commands auto-load with plugin
✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Details in separate docs, not in CLAUDE.md
✅ **Future-proof**: Ready for Microprocesso 1.3 references

## Troubleshooting

**"README.md not found"**
- Run `/brief` first to create your project specification

**"CLAUDE.md doesn't exist"**
- Command creates one automatically with just the Agentc section

**"Section already exists"**
- Command updates existing section instead of duplicating
- Preserves your other CLAUDE.md content

After running `/update-claude-md`, your project is fully integrated with Agentc AI Developer. Continue with architecture and development! 🚀
