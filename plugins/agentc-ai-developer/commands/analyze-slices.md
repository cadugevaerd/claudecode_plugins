# Analyze Slices Against S1.1 Gates

## Preconditions

1. Verify docs/BACKLOG.md exists
1. Verify Brief Minimo specification is complete in README.md
1. Ensure at least one increment is defined in backlog

If missing: Stop and guide user to run `/backlog create` first.

## Validation Mode (Default)

1. Read docs/BACKLOG.md
1. Analyze each slice (increment) against S1.1 decision gates:

### Decision Gates

For each slice, validate:

- **Gate 1 - Duration 3-6h?**: Check "Horas Estimadas" is between 3-6 hours

  - FAIL: Slice is too large (>6h) or too small (\<3h for standard cycle)
  - PASS: Duration fits standard cycle window

- **Gate 2 - Score >= 2.0?**: Calculate impact score:

  - HIGH impact = 3, MEDIUM = 2, LOW = 1
  - Score = (Impact level) / (Estimated hours / 3)
  - Must be >= 2.0 (ensures good impact-to-effort ratio)
  - FAIL: Low impact relative to effort invested
  - PASS: Efficient slice with good ROI

- **Gate 3 - Reversible?**: Assess if slice can be rolled back

  - FAIL: Slice modifies shared state or core architecture without rollback plan
  - PASS: Clear rollback strategy documented or changes are isolated

- **Gate 4 - Architecturally Isolated?**: Check coupling level

  - FAIL: Slice depends on multiple external components
  - PASS: Slice focuses on single isolated component (low coupling)

- **Gate 5 - Increases success_rate?**: Calculate contribution to success metrics

  - Extract success metric from README.md (Pergunta 5 do Brief Minimo)
  - For each slice, assess: "How does this slice move the metric toward the target?"
  - FAIL: Slice has no measurable contribution to success metric (0% delta)
  - PASS: Slice measurably improves success metric (>0% estimated delta)
  - Example:
    - Brief Target: "85% accuracy on email classification"
    - Slice 1: "Implement core classifier logic" → estimated delta +40%
    - Slice 2: "Add edge case handling" → estimated delta +15%
    - Slice 3: "Code review polish" → estimated delta +5%

3. Generate analysis report:

   - Slices that PASS all gates (GO): Ready for execution
   - Slices that FAIL any gate (NO-GO): Blockers identified
   - Summary: X GO slices / Y NO-GO slices total

1. For each NO-GO slice, list which gates failed and why

## Fast-Track Validation (S1.1 Fast-Track)

After validating against standard gates, check if slices qualify for Fast-Track (quick validation path for trivial work):

### Fast-Track Criteria

For each GO slice (passed all 5 gates), validate Fast-Track eligibility:

- **Duration < 1h?**: Estimated hours must be under 1 hour

  - FAIL: Slice takes 1h or longer (use standard development path)
  - PASS: Slice is truly trivial (\<1h)

- **Risk Level LOW?**: Assess risk classification

  - FAIL: Slice has medium/high risk (modifies core logic, API changes, etc.)
  - PASS: Low risk work (documentation, simple fixes, tests, minor refactors)

- **No Architecture Changes?**: Verify slice doesn't modify system design

  - FAIL: Slice changes interfaces, schemas, or architectural decisions
  - PASS: Slice operates within existing architecture boundaries

- **Clear Success Criteria?**: Validate acceptance criteria are simple and testable

  - FAIL: Vague success definition or complex validation needed
  - PASS: Simple, obvious success criteria (e.g., "button renders", "test passes")

### Fast-Track Decision

- **All criteria PASS**: Slice is FAST-TRACK eligible

  - Development continues in Fast-Track workflow (minimal validation, quick iteration)
  - Skip full testing cycle, use smoke tests only
  - Enable quick feedback loops for trivial work

- **Any criterion FAIL**: Slice is NOT Fast-Track eligible

  - Development returns to standard cycle (all 5 gates + full validation)
  - Requires standard testing and review process
  - Follow regular development workflow

### Fast-Track Examples

**FAST-TRACK PASS** (✅ Quick Path):

- "Add docstring to utility function" (\<1h, low risk, no architecture change, obvious success)
- "Fix typo in error message" (\<1h, low risk, no architecture change, obvious success)
- "Add test for existing function" (\<1h, low risk, no architecture change, clear success)

**FAST-TRACK FAIL** (❌ Standard Path):

- "Implement core classifier algorithm" (>6h, high risk, architecture-dependent, complex validation)
- "Refactor API response schema" (1-2h, medium risk, architecture change, requires testing)
- "Add optional parameter to function" (1h, medium risk, interface change, requires validation)

## Success Rate Calculation

For each slice, calculate how much it increases the success metric:

### Step 1: Extract baseline from Brief Minimo

- Read README.md "What is SUCCESS?" section
- Identify: Current baseline (if exists) and target metric
- Example: "Current: 45% accuracy | Target: 85% accuracy | Gap: 40%"

### Step 2: Estimate delta per slice

- For each slice, ask: "What % of the target gap does this slice close?"
- Assign estimated delta (conservative estimate):
  - Core functionality slices: 20-40% of gap
  - Enhancement slices: 10-20% of gap
  - Polish/optimization slices: 5-15% of gap
- Example breakdown for 40% gap:
  - Slice 1 (Core classifier): +25% (closes 62.5% of gap)
  - Slice 2 (Edge cases): +10% (closes 25% of gap)
  - Slice 3 (Polish): +5% (closes 12.5% of gap)

### Step 3: Validate cumulative coverage

- Sum all estimated deltas
- Check: "Do all slices together meet or exceed target?"
- Example: 25% + 10% + 5% = 40% ≥ Target 40% ✅

### Step 4: Assign success_rate contribution

- Gate 5 PASS: Slice delta > 0% (measurable contribution)
- Gate 5 FAIL: Slice delta = 0% (no measurable value)

## Refine Mode

1. Run validation analysis first
1. If all slices FAIL (entire backlog is invalid):
   - Display: "Entire backlog requires refinement"
   - Execute `/backlog refine` to initiate backlog refinement process
1. If mixed results (some GO, some NO-GO):
   - Display which slices are GO (ready to execute)
   - Display which slices need refinement
   - Ask user: "Refine failing slices now? (y/n)"
   - If yes: Execute `/backlog refine` with failing slice names

## Auto Mode

1. Run validation analysis automatically
1. If any slices FAIL gates:
   - Automatically execute `/backlog refine`
   - Pass list of failing slices to refine process
1. If all slices PASS gates:
   - Display "All slices ready for execution"
   - Show next recommended GO slice to start

## Output Summary

Display analysis results:

- Total slices analyzed
- GO slices (passed all gates)
- NO-GO slices with gate failures
- Score calculations for each slice
- **Success Rate Impact Analysis**:
  - Global success metric and target (from Brief Minimo)
  - Estimated success_rate delta for each slice (% contribution)
  - Cumulative success_rate if all slices execute sequentially
  - Validation: Total estimated delta meets or exceeds target gap
- **Fast-Track Classification**:
  - FAST-TRACK eligible slices (\<1h, low risk, no architecture changes, clear success)
  - Standard path slices (all others)
  - Workflow recommendation for each slice
- Recommendation: Next action (execute, fast-track, or refine)
- Gate failure distribution (helps identify pattern issues)

## POST-VALIDATION: Slice Tracking

After validation analysis, automatically update project files based on GO/NO-GO decisions:

### For GO Slices (All Gates Passed)

1. **Create Slice Tracker**:

   - Create directory: `docs/slices/` (if doesn't exist)
   - Create file: `docs/slices/SLICE_{N}_TRACKER.md` for each GO slice
   - Use slice number from BACKLOG.md increment (e.g., "### 1." → SLICE_1_TRACKER.md)

1. **Populate Tracker - Section 1 (Planning)**:

   - **Slice ID**: Extract from increment number (e.g., 1)
   - **Slice Name**: Copy from "### N. [Title]" in BACKLOG.md
   - **Status**: Set to "➡️ Em Progresso"
   - **Objetivo**: Copy from "- **Objetivo**:" field in BACKLOG.md (exact 1-sentence copy)
   - **Critérios de Aceitação**: Extract 3 checkpoints from "- **Tarefas**:" checklist (convert 3 tasks to acceptance criteria)
   - **Reversibilidade**: Extract from Gate 3 validation result (rollback plan)
   - **Timestamp Início**: Current ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2025-11-05T17:30:45`)

1. **Populate Tracker - Gate Validation Section**:

   - Copy all 5 Gate validation results from analysis
   - Include PASS/FAIL status, criteria met, and score

1. **Update BACKLOG.md**:

   - Find increment in BACKLOG.md (by number)
   - Replace status from "⏳ Planejado" to "📋 TODO"
   - Add new field: `- **Tracker**: [SLICE_{N}_TRACKER.md](./slices/SLICE_{N}_TRACKER.md)`

### For NO-GO Slices (Any Gate Failed)

1. **Update BACKLOG.md**:

   - Find increment in BACKLOG.md (by number)
   - Replace status from "⏳ Planejado" to "🔄 Revalidar"
   - Add field: `- **Gates Falhadas**: [Gate 1, Gate 3]` (list which gates failed)
   - Do NOT create tracker file (tracker only created for GO slices)

1. **Display Summary**:

   - Show which gates failed
   - Suggest user run `/backlog refine` to fix issues

### Fast-Track Slices (GO + All Fast-Track Criteria Pass)

1. **Update BACKLOG.md**:
   - Add field: `- **Fast-Track**: 🚀 Elegível para Fast-Track`
   - Note: This is in addition to "📋 TODO" and tracker creation

## Next Steps - Start Development

After all GO slices are validated and trackers created:

**Execute `/iniciar-slice` to start development**:

1. **Automatic slice selection**:

   - Selects next eligible slice with status `📋 TODO`
   - Prioritizes Fast-Track slices for quick wins
   - Orders by Impact level (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)

1. **Initialize development environment**:

   - Creates git branch: `slice-{N}-{kebab-case-title}`
   - Captures baseline metrics via CI.py
   - Updates BACKLOG.md: `📋 TODO` → `➡️ Em Progresso`
   - Populates Section 2 (DESENVOLVIMENTO) in SLICE_TRACKER.md

1. **Ready for TDD development**:

   - Write tests first (recommended)
   - Implement functionality
   - Track progress in SLICE_TRACKER.md Development Log
